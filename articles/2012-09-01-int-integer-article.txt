Today, I finally discovered differences between int and Integer. (short/Short, double/Double, float/Floatâ€¦).

For instance, Class Integer has some special method to work with ints.

Nevertheless, because of immutable characteristic of Integer Wrapper Class,  computational speed is better with int primitive.

Ints are very primitive, as we call them; You can only :

    - calculate with it
    - pass it as Paramater
    - return its value
    - And send it as part of an Object over RMI
