Hey, I donâ€™t have much time this morning.  Nevertheless I wanted to let this site not as empty as a basic WordPress Website.

Here is juste a sample script to change files extensions, for instance png to jpg.

    #!/bin/bash

    for f in $(find . -iregex .*\.png);
    do
        mv "$f" "${f%.png}.jpg"
    done
